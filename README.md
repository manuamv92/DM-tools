DM tools is my first Front-end project, I wanted to make a professional looking webpage that showed what I can do in a weekend or so with my actual level of skill, I choose to make it about D&D just because I love tabletop rpg's and that made it easier for me filling texts instead of leaving boring "lorem ipsums", also, I chose this theme because I had some previous scripts that I made for my rpg's that I think are cool, and I decided to embed them on the web to show that I know how to make scripts in JavaScript and embed them.

# Features

DM tools has this cool features:

- Is a mobile-first responsive design
- I've used several different technologies: such as HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JS and API's
- It includes a random location generator that generates beautiful pop-up modals with locations and encounters randomly generated through a JS script of my invention, you can prepare a D&D session in 1 click!.
- The character creation section is linked to an API, I know it would have been easier just to make the selector options writing by my self instead of using an API, but I just wanted to show-off, that I know what an API is and how to use it! ðŸ˜Ž
- The Rule section is Sync with the official SRD document, so if it is updated, my web will be too.
